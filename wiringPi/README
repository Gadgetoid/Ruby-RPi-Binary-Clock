These files should, hopefully, get you started in compiling wiringPi as a Ruby module.

You can find WiringPi here: https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/

Special thanks to Gordon for writing this handy little library, of which I'm a big fan.

One downside; you'll have to sudo ruby so that WiringPi can do its stuff.

To compile, you'll need the requisite Ruby header files, so it's best to install using RVM.

There's a handy guide to installing Ruby on the Pi here: http://elinux.org/RPi_Ruby_on_Rails#Installing_Ruby_on_Rails_on_Raspberry_Pi

But you might want to ignore the bits about Rails, ie use: "curl -L get.rvm.io | bash -s stable"

These files are for SWIG,
loose directions which may or may not get them compiled for you under Debian on the Pi are as follows:

sudo apt-get install swig
wget http://project-downloads.drogon.net/files/wiringPi.tgz
tar xfz wiringPi.tgz
cd wiringPi/wiringPi
*** copy wiringPi.i and extconf.rb into this folder ***
swig -ruby wiringPi.i
ruby extconf.rb
make
make install
