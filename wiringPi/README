These files should, hopefully, get you started in compiling wiringPi as a Ruby module.

You can find WiringPi here: https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/

You'll need the requisite Ruby header files, so it's best to install using RVM.

These files are for SWIG, loose directions which may or may not get you there
are as follows:

sudo apt-get install swig
wget http://project-downloads.drogon.net/files/wiringPi.tgz
tar xfz wiringPi.tgz
cd wiringPi/wiringPi
*** copy wiringPi.i and extconf.rb into this folder ***
swig -ruby wiringPi.i
ruby extconf.rb
make
make install
